  <h2 id="vsintro">Featurization vs Feature Engineering</h2>
  <p>Featurization is a way to change some form of data (text data, graph data, time-series data,â€¦) into a numerical vector.<p>
  <p>
    Featurization is different from feature engineering. Feature engineering is just transforming the numerical features somehow so that the machine learning 
    models  work well. In feature engineering, features are already in the numerical form. whereas in featurization data not need to be in the form of numerical 
    vector.
