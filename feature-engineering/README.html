  <h2 id="vsintro">Featurization vs Feature Engineering</h2>
  <p>Featurization is a way to change some form of data (text data, graph data, time-series data,…) into a numerical vector.<p>
  <p>
    Featurization is different from feature engineering. Feature engineering is just transforming the numerical features somehow so that the machine learning 
    models  work well. In feature engineering, features are already in the numerical form; whereas in featurization data is not need to be in the form of
    numerical vector.
  </p>
    <h2>Why Featurization?</h2>
    <p>
      The machine learning model cannot work with row text data directly. In the end, machine learning models work with numerical (categorical, real,…) 
      features. So it is import to change some type of data into numerical vector so that we can <b>leverage the whole power of linear algebra</b> (making the
      decision boundary between data points)and statistics tools with other types of data also.
