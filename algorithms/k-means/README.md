# k-means

K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Cluster here refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.
k refers to the number of clusters
means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid.
A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.
Every data point is allocated to each of the clusters through reducing the in-cluster sum of squares.

The more the value of the Dunn index, the better will be the clustering.

However, its performance is usually not as competitive as those of the other sophisticated clustering techniques because slight variations in the data could lead to high variance. Furthermore, clusters are assumed to be spherical and evenly sized, something which may reduce the accuracy of the K-means clustering Python results.
